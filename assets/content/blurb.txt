I bring ideas to life. Utilizing extensive research, attention to detail, and clean, accessible coding standards, my goal is to deliver immersive experiences that captivate users and keep them engaged from start to finish. I use HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and many other tools to combine simple yet striking aesthetics with powerful, efficient functionality.
