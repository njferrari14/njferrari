Hello. My name is Nicholas Ferrari, and I love to learn. Whether it's new technologies, skills, or the geopolitical ramifications of a fractured Orcish horde with no clear leader, I'm always studying and thinking about how to apply my knowledge to real-world projects. When I'm not developing skills to further my career, I like to explore the world on my bike or create my own worlds for friends to explore. I write stories for long-term roleplaying games, I host murder-mystery parties, and I'm always looking for my next creative opportunity. I see web development as another way to use what I learn to create immersive user experiences.
