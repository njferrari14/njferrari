                <dd><p>I primarily used JavaScript to make an app that sort of functions like Etch-a-Sketch. It lets you specify the size of a grid, populates the grid with blank squares, then changes the color of the squares when you hover over them with the cursor. You can choose a specific color, randomize the colors, and reset the grid.</p></dd>
